Resistance is Colorful

(With apoligies to ["Star Trek: The Next Generation"] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation) and their relentless enemy, [The Borg] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek))).

The resistance value of resistors (and other components) is indicated by colored bands on the resistor itself. (See [Electronic Color Code] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code)). As a young physicist, I probably committed the conversion of this color code to an actual value to memory. As a sophisticated, uber, software geek, I have grown beyond organic RAM. I can now write a program to convert these colors to values. More than that, I can create a WEB APPLICATION and use it wherever I have cell service. I can [take over the world] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain)!

Oh, "What's the 'k,'" you ask. As every young physicist knows, k stands for kilo, the prefix in [the metric system] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system)) that stands for "1000x." It reminds me of the thousands of million dollar licenses I expect to sell to all the current young physicists huddling over breadboards in Circuits-201.
